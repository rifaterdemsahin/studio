This is a tight but manageable space (). Since you are producing AI-based courses, your priority is **acoustic control** and **lighting consistency**, as AI avatars or high-quality video require clean source footage.

Given your "Video Creator Master Prompt" history, we need to design this room as a hybrid production studio and high-end workstation.

## 1. The Layout Strategy: "The L-Split"

To maximize the  footprint, place your desks along the long wall (4m) or in an "L" configuration to keep the center of the room open for your A-roll (on-camera) shots.

### Desk A: The Command Center (49" Ultra-wide)

* **Purpose:** Screen captures, video editing, and AI prompting.
* **Placement:** Against one of the 2.5m walls. The ultra-wide monitor is perfect for long video timelines and side-by-side coding/prompting.
* **Ergonomics:** Ensure this desk faces away from any windows to prevent screen glare during screen recordings.

### Desk B: The Production Stage (42" Square)

* **Purpose:** A-roll recording and monitoring.
* **Placement:** Perpendicular to Desk A or centered on the opposite 4m wall.
* **The "Studio" Aspect:** Use the 42" square monitor as a massive teleprompter or a confidence monitor so you can see your framing while recording.

## 2. A-Roll Setup (The "Set")

Since you are recording yourself for courses, you need a dedicated "set" area.

* **Background:** Use the 2.5m width behind your "Production Desk" for a clean aesthetic. A bookshelf with subtle LED accents or a motorized backdrop system (Grey/Navy) works best for AI layering.
* **Camera Placement:** Position your camera at eye level above the 42" monitor.
* **Lighting (Three-Point Setup):**
* **Key Light:** Large softbox at 45° to your face.
* **Fill Light:** Smaller LED panel to soften shadows.
* **Backlight:** A "hair light" to separate you from the background (essential for high-quality AI masking/keying).

## 3. Acoustic Treatment (Critical for Courses)

In a small  room, "boxiness" and echo will ruin your audio.

* **Bass Traps:** Place acoustic foam cubes in the top corners of the room.
* **Wall Panels:** Install 2-inch thick acoustic panels on the "first reflection points" (the spots on the walls directly to your left and right when sitting at your recording desk).
* **Floor:** If the floor is hard, a thick rug is non-negotiable to stop sound bouncing between the floor and ceiling.

## 4. Technical Integration

| Feature | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| **Cable Management** | Use under-desk trays. With two massive monitors, cable clutter will create visual "noise" in your videos. |
| **Power** | Ensure both desks are on a surge-protected circuit. 49" monitors and studio lights draw significant steady power. |
| **AI Processing** | Keep your PC tower (if applicable) away from your microphone or in a ventilated cabinet to keep fan noise out of your recordings. |

### Suggested Floor Plan

1. **Long Wall (Left):** Desk with 49" monitor (Workstation).
2. **Short Wall (Back):** Your "Set" with the 42" monitor and camera.
3. **Opposite Corner:** Acoustic panels and your lighting stands.

**Would you like me to refine this into a specific gear list based on your Video Creator Master Prompt, or should we focus on the aesthetic "look" of the AI course background?**
