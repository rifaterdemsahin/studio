## 🧪 Setup Recipe

### Step 1 — Measure and Sketch the Room
1. Measure the room: confirm 2 m × 3.5 m dimensions
2. Note door, window, and socket positions
3. Sketch at least two layout options (see `3_Simulation`)

### Step 2 — Equipment Procurement
1. **Camera** — mirrorless or DSLR (e.g. Sony ZV-E10, Canon M50 Mk II)
2. **Lens** — wide enough for a tight room (e.g. 16 mm or 24 mm equivalent)
3. **Microphone** — desk-mount condenser or shotgun (e.g. Rode NT-USB Mini, Shure MV7)
4. **Lighting** — key light + fill light (e.g. Elgato Key Light, Aputure Amaran 100x)
5. **Capture card** — if camera has HDMI out (e.g. Elgato Cam Link 4K)
6. **Tripod / arm** — camera mount solution
7. **Acoustic panels** — 4–6 panels for walls behind and beside presenter
8. **Backdrop** — collapsible or wall-mounted (optional)
9. **Cable management** — velcro ties, cable trays

### Step 3 — Install Gear
1. Place desk against the long wall (3.5 m side)
2. Mount/position key light 45° to subject, above eye level
3. Position fill light opposite side, lower intensity
4. Set up camera at eye level, 1–1.5 m from subject
5. Connect microphone and test audio levels
6. Cable-manage everything

### Step 4 — Software Configuration
1. Install OBS Studio on main machine
2. Create scenes: `Recording`, `Screen Share`, `Talking Head`, `Screen + Cam`
3. Configure audio: set microphone as default input, monitor levels
4. Set output resolution: 1920 × 1080 @ 30 fps (or 60 fps if machine allows)
5. Test recording and review footage

### Step 5 — Iterate
- Review first recording; log issues in `6_Semblance`
- Adjust lighting, mic position, camera angle as needed
- Re-record and compare
