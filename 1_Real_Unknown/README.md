## 🎯 Goal

Set up a functional video-production studio in a **2 m × 3.5 m room** at **Petersfield Mansions**.

The room is small, so every centimetre of space must be planned deliberately — lighting rigs, camera positions, desk placement, cable management, and acoustic treatment all need to fit within these constraints.

---

## ❓ The Unknown

- How can the room be arranged so that a single person can record professional-quality video without help?
- What gear can fit without making the space feel cramped on camera?
- How do lighting, sound, and camera angles interact in such a tight space?
- What is the minimum viable setup to start recording, and what can be added later?
